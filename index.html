<p>I started this project back on July 29th, 2024. Back then, I was thinking of all of the possibilities that I could do with 
    everything to make Mario Kart In Minecraft. I made raceable courses, functional items, and even a lap count! I put all of the 
    items in Minecraft that were in most Mario Kart Games, like Green Shells, or Bananas.</p>
<h2>How I Made This Project</h2>
<p>I made this project with a couple of things. The first thing is WorldEdit, who doesn't use that? WorldEdit is a downable mod to 
    add to Minecraft which allows you to use a lot of custom commands which makes it easier to build. The second thing is Blender. 
    Blender isn't used in Minecraft, but rather for the courses. I download the course model from the actual video game on a website 
    called <a href="https://models.spriters-resource.com/">The Models Resource</a>. Which is the website with downloadable video game 
    models. Then I import them into Blender and use a Blender Add-on called BlockBlender, which converts models to minecraft blocks, 
    and then I import them into Minecraft, and I would also polish some mistakes in the model.</p>

<h2>My Progress So Far</h2>
<p>I've made a lot of progress so far. Pretty much most of the game is playable with other people, and the items function well. 
    However, the most important thing is the courses. Not only I have the racing courses, but I also have the battle courses. And out 
    of all 218 courses in both categories, I've completed 98 of them. I will continue to make course by course until I've created 
    every Mario Kart Course in Minecraft. But I still don't know how I'm going to create anti-gravity in Minecraft, but I'll figure 
    it out eventually. I've finished all Super Mario Kart courses, Mario Kart 64 courses, Mario Kart: Super Circuit courses, Mario 
    Kart: Double Dash!! courses, and the first two cups of Mario Kart DS.</p>
