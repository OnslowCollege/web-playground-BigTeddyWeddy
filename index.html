<h2>About This Project</h2>
<p>I started this project back on July 29th, 2024. Back then, I was thinking of all of the possibilities that I could do with 
    everything to make <em>Mario Kart</em> In <em>Minecraft</em>. I made raceable courses, functional items, and even a lap count! 
    I put all of the items in Minecraft that were in most Mario Kart Games, like Green Shells, and Bananas. My goal is to remake every 
    Mario Kart course in the series in Minecraft (Not including the Arcade Mario Kart Games). The reason I'm not including the Arcade 
    Mario Kart Games is because they don't get recognized by Nintendo and they are unknown to a lot of people. I'm also not including 
    retros because they are remade versions of older courses, which means they are exactly the same.</p>

<h2>How I Made This Project</h2>
<p>I made this project with a couple of things. The first thing is <em>WorldEdit</em>, who doesn't use that? WorldEdit is a downable 
    mod to add to Minecraft which allows you to use a lot of custom commands which makes it easier to build. The second thing is 
    <em>Blender</em>. Blender isn't used in Minecraft, but rather for the courses. I download the course model from the actual video 
    game on a website called <a href="https://models.spriters-resource.com/">The Models Resource</a>. Which is the website with 
    downloadable video game models. Then I import them into Blender and use a Blender Add-on called <em>BlockBlender</em>, which converts 
    models to minecraft blocks, and then I import them into Minecraft, and I would also polish some mistakes in the model.</p>

<h2>My Progress So Far</h2>
<p>I've made a lot of progress so far. Pretty much most of the game is playable with other people, and the items function well. 
    However, the most important thing is the courses. Not only I have the racing courses, but I also have the battle courses. And out 
    of all 218 courses in both categories, I've completed 98 of them. I will continue to make course by course until I've created 
    every Mario Kart Course in Minecraft. But I still don't know how I'm going to create anti-gravity in Minecraft, but I'll figure 
    it out eventually. I've finished all <em>Super Mario Kart</em> courses, <em>Mario Kart 64</em> courses, <em>Mario Kart: Super 
    Circuit</em> courses, <em>Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</em> courses, and the first two cups of <em>Mario Kart DS</em>.</p>
